# Personal Library

Are you a self-proclaimed bookworm with an overfilled bookcase? Do you enjoy sharing your books with other avid readers? Do you ever find it difficult to keep track of which book you've lent to whom? Well look no further, because I've got a solution for you!

I created the Personal Library using python and sqlite3. In total, there are three relational tables that will allow you to manage your book loans. You can keep track of what books you own, information about the fellow readers who have borrowed a book, and the specifics of each loan - ie who borrowed what book. All tasks are completed in the command prompt via a menu.
